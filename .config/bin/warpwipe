# This script is used to wipe a specified block device really fast compared to a more traditional wipe such as pulling random data from /dev/urandom or something like that. This script works by leveraging AES-NI through openssl to do the heavy lifting of generating random data.
# DEPENDENCIES: "pv" must be installed before running this script
# USAGE SAMPLE: warpwipe /dev/sda
# DISCLAIMER: This script has not been audited and comes with no guarantee of safety or effectiveness for any intended purpose. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
